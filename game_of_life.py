Key:
[] = Alive
## = Dead

Rule 1: Any cell with less than 2 living neighbors, dies.
Rule 2: Any living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors, stays alive.
 __ __ __        __ __ __
|[]|__|__|      |##|__|__|
|__|[]|__|  ->  |__|[]|__|
|__|__|[]|      |__|__|##|
Living:  3      Living: 1

Rule 3: Any cell with greater than 3 neighbors, dies.
 __ __ __        __ __ __
|__|[]|__|      |__|[]|__|
|[]|[]|[]|  ->  |[]|##|[]|
|__|[]|__|      |__|[]|__|
Living:  5      Living:  4

Rule 4: Any cell with exactly 3 neighbors, lives.
 __ __ __        __ __ __
|[]|__|[]|      |##|[]|##|
|__|[]|__|  ->  |__|[]|__|
|__|__|__|      |__|__|__|
Living:  3      Living:  2

Example of all 4 in effect:
 __ __ __        __ __ __
|[]|__|[]|      |[]|[]|##|
|[]|[]|__|  ->  |[]|##|__|
|[]|__|__|      |[]|__|__|


End Conditions:
1. No living squares,           extinction.
2. No moving squares,           stasis.
3. Infinite repeating pattern,  symbiosis.
